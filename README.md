# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.  
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.

# Yearly routine

- copy last years directories `cp -R 2023/* 2024`
- remove inputs & code `cd 2024 && rm -rf src/day* && rm inputs/*`
- Edit the .idea folder in the root project, add a row for the new year to be able to run it in IntelliJ
- follow the README.md in 2024 folder to generate each day
