# Advent of Code Kotlin

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.  
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.

## How to use

- Open the project with [InteliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Each day is in the folder `src/DayXX.kt`, it contains a `main()` function that will read the input files and do the `part1()` and `part2()` of the problem.
- Each day has it's own `*.txt` files that serves as inputs, the `test.txt` is generally the given example and `input.txt` was my input during that day.
