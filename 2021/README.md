# How to use


- Open the project with [InteliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

- Each day is in the folder `src/dayXX` that contains a `DayXX.kt` file. The file has a `main()` function that will read the input files and do the `part1()` and `part2()` of the problem.

- Each day has its own `*.txt` files that serves as inputs, the `test.txt` is generally the given example and `input.txt` was my input during that day.
